/usr/lib64/python3.9/tarfile.py:2288: RuntimeWarning: The default behavior of tarfile extraction has been changed to disallow common exploits (including CVE-2007-4559). By default, absolute/parent paths are disallowed and some mode bits are cleared. See https://access.redhat.com/articles/7004769 for more details.

_pickle.UnpicklingError: Weights only load failed. Re-running `torch.load` with `weights_only` set to `False` will likely succeed, but it can result in arbitrary code execution. Do it only if you got the file from a trusted source.
 Please file an issue with the following so that we can make `weights_only=True` compatible with your use case: WeightsUnpickler error: Attempting to deserialize object on a CUDA device but torch.cuda.is_available() is False. If you are running on a CPU-only machine, please use torch.load with map_location=torch.device('cpu') to map your storages to the CPU.

Check the documentation of torch.load to learn more about types accepted by default with weights_only https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.load.html.
